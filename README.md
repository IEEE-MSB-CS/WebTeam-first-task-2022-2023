# WebTeam-first-task-2022-2023 (building a todo App)

## what we are going to build?
   Hi people, we are going to build a fullstack To-do List App That Applies Spaced Repetition Methodology. </br>

   **Spaced repetition:** is a method of reviewing material at systematic intervals.

## How does the app work?
   - the user first will set the classes that he have in the study table page (each class have a specified time to start in).</br>
   
     ![New-Class](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53185493/198854582-ef4cdcea-eaf0-4008-b96a-386c0920b92d.png)

   - after setting the new class or the new subject it will appear in the table directly.</br>
   
     ![Study-table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53185493/198854585-d5a0637f-7f19-4854-b366-3d4cb093fb8b.png)

   - the day that the user will have a class to study in will have a todo task in the tasks list which is the main page of the app.</br>
   
     ![Tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53185493/198854586-97b990b3-1b37-46e6-8b0e-6d4577cbf7e3.png)

   - when the user check for the task to be done it will move on to the revision table.</br>
   
     ![Revision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53185493/198854584-7c05d23b-ef43-423c-bf9a-ad3e2e8ba82e.png)

   - revisions move to the revisions table with the coming day to do based on these intervals.
   
      - 1st revision after 1 day of the new study 
      - 2nd revision after 2 days of the last revison
      - 3rd revision after 1 week of the last revision.
      - 4th revision after 3 weeks of the last revision.
      - 5th revision after 1 month of the last revision.

   - the main page of the app will have to lists: </br>
   
      1- primary tasks(sechduled tasks from the study and revision tables).</br>
      2- secondary tasks(my day tasks that will be added daily for specific things).</br>

## Notes:

  - there is no creativity limit so do it in the best for you.
  - we need a fullstack app so it will have (Authentecation, database etc...)
  - for Emad you will work without frame work so there are two videos in the resources that will help you in the routing stuff etc.


## Deadline:
   you have two weeks from now the app will not take a long time ISA so enjoy it.
